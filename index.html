				<h2>Debut album</h2>
				<p style="padding: 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came to Hanoi and met with musician Huy Tuan and discussed the implementation of her first album. After that, Huy Tuan joined her debut album's production, which was called "24 Hours 7 Days", released in 2004 by Viet Tan Studio.  Songs included in the album are produced by Tuan and are composed by famous composers such as Duc Tri, Nguyen Xinh Xo, Hong Kien, Duong Thu, and An Hieu. In the album, the title song gained a lot of success and was performed by Ha on various music shows. Despite much investment, this album did not make much resonance for Hà because the album was not widely advertised and there was no promotional music video, until her nude "art" photos were posted online; then her name was said to be "floating like alcohol". In addition, that was when feelings emerged between Hà and musician Duc Tri.</p>

				<p>On 20 April 2010, Ha confirmed in an interview that she was pregnant.The father, Nguyen Quoc Cuong, is said to be one of the richest men in Vietnam, though she prefers to keep quiet about their relationship. "I never wanted to talk to the press about Cuong. If my lover was not Cuong, there would have never been this kind of manhunt. But this is normal curiosity, and nobody knows the truth better than me.</p>
